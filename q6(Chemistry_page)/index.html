    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
    <p>Chemisrty is the branch of science that deals with the properties,composition,and behavior of matter. It is a fascinating fiels theat explores the buldings blocks of the universe.</p>
    <h2>Chemistry Elemensts</h2>
    <p>The <mark> periodic table </mark> is a babular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol,such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen,and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.</p>
    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
    <p>Chemical reactions are represented using chemical equations. Here's an example of a chemical reaction:</p>
    <p>2H <sub>2</sub>+ O<sub>2</sub> &rarr; 2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
    <p>This is equations representes the reaction between hydrogen gas (H<sub>2)</sub>and oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>)to from water (H<sub>2</sub>O)</p>
    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    <p>Stoichiometry is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves chemical equationsto ensure mass and charge are conserved.</p>
    <p><sub>sumscripts</sub> indicate the numbers of atoms of each elements in a molecule, while <sup>superscript</sup> represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.</p>
    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. Froom the composition of the air we breathe to the reaction that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.</p>
